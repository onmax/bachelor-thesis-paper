\subsubsection{Kaggle competition: Shared bikes demand forecasting} \label{kaggle_competition}


The Kaggle platform is a platform where those interested in Data Science can share blogs, knowledge, and datasets among other resources. In addition, the platform itself or companies that want to hire new personnel who are experts in Data Science frequently hold competitions where any person or team in the world can participate, which is why it is common to see multiple competitions active on Kaggle with different problems related to Big Data and its datasets.
\newline


During the summer of 2020, a competition took place \cite{kaggleCompetition} that attempted to solve the same problem that has been proposed in this paper: predicting the number of trips that will be made from each of the stations in a city. In this case, the competition used a dataset that included: city (there were multiple cities), time in hours, number of bicycles in an hour, a multitude of variables in relation to meteorology (20 variables) and an associated work schedule.

The metric used to measure the models delivered by the participants was the \acrshort{rmsle} and the best results obtained were the following:
