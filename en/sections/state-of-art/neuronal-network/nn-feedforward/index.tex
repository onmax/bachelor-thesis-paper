\subsection{Artificial neural networks. Forward-pass algorithm.}

Neural networks are algorithms used in the field of Artificial Intelligence and try to solve problems in which one works with a large amount of data trying to find patterns in them. Furthermore, it is one of the few alternatives to other algorithms that can treat large volumes of data.
\newline

The beginnings of neural networks date back to the 1950s, when McCulloch and WalterPitts \cite{kleene} worked on a mathematical model that resembled the behaviour of a neuron that they knew. The scientist Frank Rosenblatt, inspired by this work, developed what are known as networks of perceptions. This was the first approach to what is now known as neural networks \cite{nielsen}.
