    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a type of neural networks that use feedback connections. Several types of RNN models are used for forecasting time series. This project was conducted to study them theorically and develop models to predict bike usage in Chicago city based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Approach and to measure the accuracy of the models developed and compare the results with other neural networks using pass-forward tecnique or similar projects. Feedforward, Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and auto-regressive architectures were employed in building models. The models predict based on a sliding windows of intervals of 1 hour. The output of the models is a vector with values with the prediction of every station in the city for a certain interval. Datetime is the only input that the neural network and with only that, out-standing results have been calculated. The metrics used to measure the model's precission is in the same line as state-of-the-art project   LSTM and AR networks generally produce lower errors compared with feedforward networks but in some occasions, the error is higher than feed forward networks but depends on the inputs which is expected.
