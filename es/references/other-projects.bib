abstract = "Bike-sharing systems operate in a number of cities around the world, aiming to promote sustainable urban mobility. Successful management of these systems is to a large extent linked to the optimal distribution of bicycles, which implies the accurate prediction of demand for rentals and returns at each station within the day. For this purpose, a tool for predicting bike demand for rentals and returns and visualizing the results has been developed and is presented in the present paper. Different predictive models based on machine learning regression algorithms are trained and evaluated. The tool is tested using data from the bike-sharing system that operates in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece for which the results indicate that the tested system’s utilization is highly correlated to the location and spatial characteristics of a station, as well as the season of the year and time of day. The proposed machine learning algorithms use custom engineered features to learn those correlations and achieve the highest possible performance."

abstract = "This study proposes a novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network with Data-driven Graph Filter (GCNN-DDGF) model that can learn hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations to predict station-level hourly demand in a large-scale bike-sharing network. Two architectures of the GCNN-DDGF model are explored; GCNNreg-DDGF is a regular GCNN-DDGF model which contains the convolution and feedforward blocks, and GCNNrec-DDGF additionally contains a recurrent block from the Long Short-term Memory neural network architecture to capture temporal dependencies in the bike-sharing demand series. Furthermore, four types of GCNN models are proposed whose adjacency matrices are based on various bike-sharing system data, including Spatial Distance matrix (SD), Demand matrix (DE), Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD), and Demand Correlation matrix (DC). These six types of GCNN models and seven other benchmark models are built and compared on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes 272 stations and over 28 million transactions from 2013 to 2016. Results show that the GCNNrec-DDGF performs the best in terms of the Root Mean Square Error, the Mean Absolute Error and the coefficient of determination (R2), followed by the GCNNreg-DDGF. They outperform the other models. Through a more detailed graph network analysis based on the learned DDGF, insights are obtained on the “black box” of the GCNN-DDGF model. It is found to capture some information similar to details embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices. More importantly, it also uncovers hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that are not revealed by any of those matrices."
